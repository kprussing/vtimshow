ViTables Image Viewer
=====================

This is a plug-in to `ViTables`_ to view 2D data sets as images.  A long
term goal is to answer the problems addressed in `Issue #11`_.  This
plug-in is designed to work with the development branch of ViTables
(2.2a1), and, therefore, uses ``setuptools`` to declare the entry points
into ``vitables.plugins``.
